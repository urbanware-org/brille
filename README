    Definition

        Python module that allows converting a string into the Braille
        alphabet and vice versa.

    Details

        The definition above actually explains it all. Simple and easy to use.

        Notice that this module uses the Python 3.x framework. There is no
        official version for Python 2.x, but if you need that for whatever
        reason, you can try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to version
        2.x using the "3to2" tool. However, there is no guarantee that this
        works properly or at all.

        Furthermore, the module requires a shell that uses UTF-8 encoding,
        otherwise it will not work.
        
        The code was written on Linux and has only been tested on that
        platform, yet.

        Feel free to modify!

    Usage

        Convert (encode) a string into the Braille alphabet

            To convert the string "This is an example" into the Braille
            alphabet, type:

                braille = brille.string2braille("This is an example")

            Supported characters are letters, numbers and spaces. All others
            will be ignored. The Braille letters will be returned using UTF-8
            characters.

        Convert (decode) the Braille alphabet into a string

            The other way around, to convert Braille letters into a string,
            type:

                string = brille.braille2string("⠞⠓⠊⠎ ⠊⠎ ⠁⠝ ⠑⠭⠁⠍⠏⠇⠑"))

            Notice that you can only use the UTF-8 characters to enter the
            Braille letters. All other characters will be ignored.

    Useless facts

        The missing "a" inside the project name "Brille" is not a typo. The
        word "Brille" is German for "glasses".
